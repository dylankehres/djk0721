Demo for a simple Tool Rental Store application using Java, JUnit, and Firebase.

To connect to the database you have 2 options, use the key that was sent with this project or create your own firebase project. 

Option 1:
Download the firebase-adminsdk json file and place it in the ToolStoreDemo folder. 
Feel free to tinker, but be mindful this is a real database, and the records created will exist until you call the proper deletion method or until I delete them manually from the console. All tests and the main method will clean up the database after each run.


Option 2:
 Set up your own firebase project, change the project name in FirebaseInit.java, and place your firebase-adminsdk json file in the ToolStoreDemo folder. 
 For instructions on setting up a firebase project please use the documentation at this link https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#java
